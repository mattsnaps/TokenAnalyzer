# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week?

The First Two labs went well and quick.

#### What didn't go so well this week?

The last lab i struggled to figure out.  My work load in other classes is high right now.
So I haven't been able to dedicate as much time last weekend. 

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work?
