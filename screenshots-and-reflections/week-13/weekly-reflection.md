# Weekly Reflection

#### What went well this week? 

Everything went well. During the MVC project I was peeping ahead at this JSTL because I knew I wanted a foreach loop. Glad to know how it works now.

#### What didn't go so well this week? 

Nothing too much.

#### What additional resources did you use or what help did you receive to complete your work? 

No other resources.
